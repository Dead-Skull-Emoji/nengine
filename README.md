# Nengine

The Nengine is an open sourced game engine made by the Li Institution. As of writing this, it is in very early development and is definitely not production ready. So far, all it has is a basic, practically non-functional event system and a Vulkan back-end with pretty much nothing in it. Feel free to check back here later.
